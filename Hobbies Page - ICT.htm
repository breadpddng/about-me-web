<h2>Art > Athletics</h2>
<p>As someone who really enjoys making art, I've always lacked strength in athletics, which is why I prefer art over atheletics. Despite my bias, I still think that art is superior to athletics, because you can incorperate art practically anywhere (including athletics as well). Ballet, Jazz, Tap, etc. are all athletics and types of dance that surround art. Music, writing, amd painting, are just a few examples of how art is expressed :).</p>
<p>Even if you don't agree with me, that's okay. To each their own :D</p>

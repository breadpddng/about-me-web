<h1>Side Hobbies</h1>


<h4><pre>
Hello! This page explores some hobbies I have on the side.

I'll talk about 3 main topics!</pre></h4>
<pre>
<ol>
 <li>Making drinks</li>
 <li>Piano</li>
 <li>Music + taste</li>
</ol>
</pre>

<h3>Making Drinks</h3>
<p>I really enjoy making drinks in my free time! I really enjoy things like bubble tea and coffee, so to both save money and explore my creativity, I like to make drinks and make different flavours.</p>
<p>Here's a recipe that I reccomend! It's pretty and tasteful :)</p>
<p><b>Strawberry Matcha Drink</b></p>
<pre>
<ol>
 <li>Milk (any kind)</li>
 <li>Strawberry flavouring (Syrup, Strawberries, Powder, etc.)</li>
 <li>Matcha powder</li>
 <li>Green Tea</li>
 <li>[optional] Ice</li>
</ol>
</pre>
<h4>Steps!</h4>
<p>Add the strawberry flavouring to any milk of your choice and mix it up in a cup. In another cup, Mix up the matcha powder with a bit of hot water while steeping the tea. Once you have your strawberry milk and matcha green tea, add each component into a cup (slowly) to create a green and pink masterpiece! To prevent it from mixing while pouring it in, add a layer of ice in between the two parts.<p>

<h3>Piano</h3>
<p>I've been playing piano for 10 years, and I'm almost finished! I always found practicing somewhat dreadful, but I do enjoy playing piano without all the shackles that come with trying to get a high mark per level during exams. The test taking really sucked all the fun-ness of piano for me, but I still love playing pieces that are really expressive!</p>

<h3>Music!</h3>
<p>I didn't listen to music very often, until 6th grade. I started mu spotify account and now I spend hundreds of thousands of minutes listening (quite literally). Last year, I beat 99.5% of all Canadian listeners with my listening time. I spent a grand total of 170, 032 minutes on spotify. At this point, I think I have a mild music addiction and the posibility of me going deaf at age 30 (because I wear earbuds way too often) is raising by the day. Regardless, music is one of my favourite ways of expression and I love sharing music taste with others!</p>
